Think step by step before providing the rules.

Provide a minimum set of rules that describe the input-output transformations, i.e. how an input character is transformed into its corresponding output character based on input characters coming before it in the input.
Each rule describes how a character in the input is transformed into the output based on the context of the input characters preceding it.

For example: 
a rule 'abc --> a' means that the input character 'c' is transformed into 'a' in the output when it is preceded by 'ab' in the input. 
Another example:
a rule 'fqerrqb --> s' means that the input character 'b' is transformed into 's' in the output when it is preceded by 'fqerrq' in the input.
Therefore the left part of the rule basically describe the input context in which the input character is transformed into the output character.
Notice that the last character of the left part is the character to be transformed. 
The right part of the rule is the output character that the input character is transformed into. It can be a single character or a sequence of characters, it can also be empty string.

You don't need to provide trivial rules where input and output are the same, like 'abdsa -> a' or 'frqeb -> b'.
Notice that the left part of each rule always have length <= {}. 

Write rules in the following format:
left -> right

Surround rules by XML tags <START> and <END> like below:

<START>
left1 -> right1
left2 -> right2
...
leftn -> rightn
<END>

THE RIGHT PART OF THE RULE SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN WHAT THE LAST CHARACTER OF THE LEFT PART IS TRANSFORMED INTO INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE STRING.
